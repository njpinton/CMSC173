• Fully connected layers
• Good for tabular data
• Limited to simple patterns
• We learned these already!
Advanced Architectures
• CNNs: For images and spatial data
• Transformers: For text and sequences
• GANs: Generate new data
• VAEs: Learn compressed representations
• Diffusion: Create high-quality images
Why Learn These?
They power the AI you use every day:
• ChatGPT (Transformer)
• DALL-E 2 (Diffusion)
• Face unlock on phones (CNN)
• Google Translate (Transformer)
• AI art generators (GAN/Diffusion)
This Module’s Focus

CNNs: What Are They?
Simple Explanation
CNNs are neural networks designed for images.
They work by:
• Looking at small patches of the image
• Finding patterns (edges, shapes, textures)
• Building up to complex objects
• Making decisions based on what they see
Why Not Regular NNs?
• Images have too many pixels
• Spatial relationships matter
Key Insight
CNNs learn to recognize patterns automatically - no
manual feature engineering!

How CNNs Process Images
Processing Pipeline
Input Image →Find Edges →Find Shapes →Find Objects →Decision
Analogy
Like how humans see: First we see lines and edges, then shapes, then we recognize ”this is a cat!”

VAE Application: Anomaly Detection
Manufacturing Quality Control
How It Works:
• Train VAE on normal products
• VAE learns what ”normal” looks like
• Defects reconstruct poorly
• High reconstruction error = defect!
Real Applications
• Detect scratches on surfaces
• Find cracks in materials
• Identify missing components
• Automated quality inspection
Other Anomaly Detection Uses
• Cybersecurity: Detect network intrusions
• Finance: Identify fraudulent transactions
• Healthcare: Flag unusual patient vitals
• IoT: Detect sensor failures
Advantage
Works without labeled defect examples - learns from
normal data only!

VAE Application: Image Compression
Why VAEs for Compression?
Advantages over JPEG:
• Better quality at low bitrates
• Learned compression (adapts to content)
• Can compress to tiny sizes
• Semantic preservation
How It Works
• Encoder compresses to latent code
• Store only the small code
• Decoder reconstructs when needed
• 10-100x smaller than JPEG
Real-World Uses
• Store medical imaging archives
• Stream video at lower bandwidth
• Compress satellite imagery
• Mobile app image caching
Research Example
Google’s neural image compression beats JPEG by
50% in quality metrics!

More Ethical Considerations
Copyright &amp; Intellectual Property
Questions:
• Who owns AI-generated content?
• Is training on copyrighted data fair use?
• Should artists be compensated?
• How to attribute AI creations?
Current Debates:
• Ongoing lawsuits (artists vs AI companies)
• New legislation being proposed
• Industry opt-out mechanisms
Job Displacement
Concerns:
• Will AI replace creative jobs?
• Impact on artists, writers, designers
• Economic inequality
• Need for reskilling
Opportunities:
• AI as a tool, not replacement
• New creative possibilities
• Democratization of creation
• Focus on uniquely human skills
Your Responsibility
As future AI practitioners, think critically about the impact of your work!

Key Concept: Attention Mechanism

</div>

<div class="page-number">Page 54 of 65</div>
<div class="page-content">
Understanding Attention
What is Attention?
A mechanism that lets neural networks focus on relevant parts:
• In text: Focus on important words in a sentence

Attention Example: Language Translation
Problem Without Attention
Translating: ”The cat sat on the mat”
Old approach:
• Process word by word left to right
• Forget earlier context
• Struggle with long sentences
• Poor word alignment
With Attention
For each output word, the model:
• Looks at ALL input words
• Focuses on relevant ones
• ”sat” pays attention to ”cat” and ”mat”
• Handles long-distance dependencies
• Better translation quality
Why It’s Revolutionary
Attention enabled Transformers to outperform all previous architectures!

Tips for Using AI Image Generators
Writing Good Prompts
Be specific:
• Describe style (photorealistic, cartoon, oil
painting)
• Specify details (colors, lighting, mood)
• Mention composition (close-up, wide shot)
• Add quality keywords (4K, detailed, masterpiece)
Example Good Prompt
”A majestic golden retriever sitting in a flower
meadow at sunset, photorealistic, warm lighting,
shallow depth of field, 4K quality”
Iteration is Key
• Generate multiple variations
• Refine your prompt
• Use negative prompts (what to avoid)
• Adjust parameters (steps, guidance)
• Learn from community prompts
Pro Tip
Check out prompt libraries (Lexica.art,
PromptHero) to learn from others!

Common Challenges &amp; Solutions
Challenge: Poor Results
If outputs look bad:
• Improve your prompt specificity
• Try different seed values
• Adjust generation parameters
• Use a different model/variant
• Increase generation steps
Challenge: Wrong Anatomy/Details
Known limitations:
• Hands and fingers often wrong
• Text in images unclear
• Physics may be incorrect
• Use inpainting to fix specific parts
Challenge: Slow Generation
Speed up:
• Use lower resolution first
• Reduce number of steps
• Try faster samplers
• Use GPU acceleration
• Consider paid services for speed
Challenge: Reproducibility
Get consistent results:
• Save your seed numbers
• Keep prompt exactly the same
• Note all parameters used
• Use img2img for variations
